/*

EXAMPLE 

You divert some more energy to the weapons system. Your aim on the Ghuang 
 * improves slightly but the Ghuang also manages to pull out a good maneuvre 
 * and gain strategic positioning.

The Ghuang's front laser misses you by only a few meters. Your rear turret 
 * fires at the opponent and hits his cockpit. The enemy ship goes up in a 
 * bright explosion.
