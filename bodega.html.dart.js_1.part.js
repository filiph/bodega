Her captain insisted on having _no_ artificial gravity in the cargo bay at all. So the ship saved a little more energy, but the work in the cargo bay was hell. Nothing stayed in place, and every simple thing required much more planning and energy. The spacemen that served on the Bleeding Edge's cargo bay for more than a few years were going mad and sickly. They couldn't even stand straight in normal gravity, and their bones broke too easily. It was evil \u2013 not to mention against regulations. Luckily, you left the Bleeding Edge a few months after joining.\n\nHaving that experience makes the 20% gravity here feel almost like a luxury, especially since anyone working in the cargo bay could directly change the gravity setting himself \u2013 on the console right here in the bay.

Each of them is exactly the same size (6 meters long, 2\xbd meters high and 2\xbd meters wide), but they do differ greatly in color, signage, age \u2013 and contents. They are stacked inside long parallel racks that go all the way to the backside of the cargo bay, and all the way down to the bottom of the space.\n\nThere are long, narrow corridors between the racks \u2013 so that the crew can access each container to help with unloading, check on a container's status, contain leaks. The corridors' floors are nothing more than sheets of perforated steel fixed in between the racks. They are sturdy, replacable, and see-through.\n\n[IMG of cargo bay]\n\nTwo things hit you every time you enter the cargo bay. First, the cold and damp air. The cargo bay is heated _just_ enough so that people can work here for hours. Second, and more profoundly, the artificial gravity here is set to a very low value: only 20% of the standard. The moment you pass the threshold of the cargo bay door, you feel your stomach jump and you have to fight a brief sensation of falling. It's like the whole ship went into an instant dive. Luckily, your brain has learnt to deal with this and in a few seconds, you feel okay. The next step is to start walking and moving in a way that doesn't launch you to the ceiling, but again - you've had enough experience that it comes naturally now.\n\nYou remember a brief stint a few years back at a cargo ship called the Bleeding Edge. Her captain insisted on having _no_ artificial gravity in the cargo bay at all. So the ship saved a little more energy, but the work in the cargo bay was hell. Nothing stayed in place, and every simple thing required much more planning and energy. The spacemen that served on the Bleeding Edge's cargo bay for more than a few years were going mad and sickly. They couldn't even stand straight in normal gravity, and their bones broke too easily. It was evil \u2013 not to mention against regulations. You left the Bleeding Edge a few months after joining.\n\nHaving that experience makes the 20% gravity here feel almost like a luxury, especially since anyone working in the cargo bay could directly change the gravity setting himself \u2013 on the console right here in the bay. On the other hand, almost nobody ever took advantage of that. They knew how expensive \u2013 energy wise \u2013 it can get, and they were mostly used to the idea of low gravity by the time they joined the Bodega.\n")
